# Linux Basic Library
I know, this little guy looks cute, but make people crazy daily.<br>
I hear you; I have been in your shoes many times before, and I know the feeling. 

In my Git, you will find the most useful commands that cover mostly basic to intermediate tasks on Linux.<br> 
A compact and handy library of regular Linux commands for daily use, organized into categories for easy identification based on your needs.

All you need is a device running a Linux distro.<br>
For beginners, I would recommend [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) or [Debian](https://www.debian.org/distrib/), two of the most well-known Linux distributions<br> 
that are widely used in IT infrastructure.

For practicing and studying, I strongly recommend installing Linux on a Virtual Machine or, even better, in a Linux Container.
If you don't know how to set up a virtual environment, check out the Proxmox folder,<br> 
I have written a guide on how to easily set up Proxmox and get ready to dive into Linux.

That's it! Embrace the Penguin!
