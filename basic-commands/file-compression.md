A ```tar.gz``` file is a common archive format used in Unix and Unix-like systems, including Linux. It is a combination of two different types of files:

**TAR (Tape Archive):** This is a file format used to collect many files into one single archive file, often called a tarball. It doesn't compress the files; it just bundles them together. The extension for TAR files is usually ```.tar```.

**Gzip (GNU zip):** This is a compression utility that compresses the files to reduce their size. The extension for Gzip compressed files is ```.gz```.

When you combine these two formats, you get a ```tar.gz``` file, which is a compressed archive. The ```.tar.gz``` extension indicates that the file is a tarball that has been compressed with Gzip.

To create a ```tar.gz``` file, you can use the tar command with the ```-czf``` options.<br>
This command compresses the ```directory/``` into a ```tar.gz``` archive named ```archive.tar.gz```.
```
tar -czf archive.tar.gz directory/
```
<br>

To extract a ```tar.gz``` file, you use the tar command with the ```-xzf``` options:
```
tar -xzf archive.tar.gz
```
